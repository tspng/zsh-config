# tspng's zsh config

Just my personal zsh config.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Should work on most Unix or Linux operating systems such as macOS, Linux, BSD or Windows WSL.
But it's mainly tested on macOS, only.

* [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org)
* `curl`
* `git`

### Installation

Run the following command in your terminal for an automatic installation:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tspng/zsh-config/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Update

```shell
cd ~/.zsh && git pull --recurse-submodules
```
